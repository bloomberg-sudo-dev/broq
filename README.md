## 🎥 What Is Broq?

Broq is a **visual programming tool** designed to make LLM workflows modular, remixable, and fun.  
It’s like **Scratch for prompt engineering** — build GPT pipelines by connecting colorful blocks.

- Prototype GPT-based tools without writing code
- Teach students or teams how AI logic flows work
- Visualize, test, and modify flows faster than any JSON or script

## 💡 Use Cases

### 🧱 Visual Prompt Builder  
Craft and refine prompts with block logic instead of code.

### 🔁 Batch Text Transformer  
Apply the same LLM prompt to multiple chunks of input — great for rewriting lists, titles, or notes.

### 🧩 If/Then Prompt Logic  
Use simple conditions to dynamically decide how your GPT workflows respond to input.

## 🧠 Philosophy

LLMs are powerful — but code isn't always the right interface.

Broq lets people **think in blocks**, not syntax.
It's a tool for:

* Tinkerers and blocky thinkers
* Educators teaching AI
* Makers prototyping ideas
* Beginners learning LLMs
