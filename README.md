## 🎥 What Is Broq?

Broq is a **visual programming tool** designed to make LLM workflows modular, remixable, and fun.  
It’s like **Scratch for prompt engineering** — build GPT pipelines by connecting colorful blocks.

- Prototype GPT-based tools without writing code
- Teach students or teams how AI logic flows work
- Visualize, test, and modify flows faster than any JSON or script

## 🖼️ Demo Preview

| Drag & Drop Blocks | Run the Flow | Load Example Template |
|--------------------|--------------|------------------------|
| ![drag-blocks.gif](assets/drag-blocks.gif) | ![run-flow.gif](assets/run-flow.gif) | ![load-template.gif](assets/load-template.gif) |

> **📹 What to Record:**
> - `drag-blocks.gif`: Show Start → LLM → Output being connected
> - `run-flow.gif`: Click "Run Flow" and show text result in right pane
> - `load-template.gif`: Load a saved flow with multiple blocks pre-configured

## ✨ Features

- 🧱 **Visual Programming** – Drag and drop blocks to build LLM apps
- 💬 **LLM-Powered** – Works with GPT-4, Claude, and custom APIs
- 🧠 **If/Then/Else Logic** – Add basic flow control in seconds
- 📦 **Flow Management** – Save, load, and remix flows
- 🧾 **Multiline Input Support**
- 🎨 **Light/Dark Mode Theming**
- 🔁 **Repeat & Remix-Friendly** – A creative playground for AI builders

## 💡 Use Cases

### 🧱 Visual Prompt Builder  
Craft and refine prompts with block logic instead of code.

### 🔁 Batch Text Transformer  
Apply the same LLM prompt to multiple chunks of input — great for rewriting lists, titles, or notes.

### 🧩 If/Then Prompt Logic  
Use simple conditions to dynamically decide how your GPT workflows respond to input.

## 🧠 Philosophy

LLMs are powerful — but code isn't always the right interface.

Broq lets people **think in blocks**, not syntax.
It's a tool for:

* Educators teaching AI
* Makers prototyping ideas
* Beginners learning LLMs
* Experts tired of wiring JSON by hand
